# This .env is new, created by AWS EB machinery and populated with the
# environment variables we add from the AWS console. As of now
# (2022-10-13) AWS puts the application in a staging folder
# (/var/app/staging) and then copies everything to a current folder
# (/var/app/current). This script is executed at the root of the
# staging folder where the .env file is located. So, we are using this
# .env file to get the environment variables required to call SSM
# Parameter Store and retrieve all the environment variables for the
# project. Finally we append the SSMPS result to the same .env file
# which will be copied by the EB system to the current folder.
